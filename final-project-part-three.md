## The audience

My target audience is policymakers/local government officials and specifically those in communitites affected by pollution from the steel manufacturing process. I decided to make this switch primarily because of the insights I gained during the interview process. The individuals that I interviewed provided perspectives that I had not considered like the fact that residents might not understand how to advocate for themselves and making policymakers the target audience eliminates the middle man between residents and elected officials. Targeting policymakers removes a further burden on the residents. Finally, the advice that really made me realize I should change my target audience to policymakers was the advice that that residents of frontline communities already know the health risks that they are experiencing due to steel production. They donâ€™t need to hear the story of it because it is THEIR story.
