# Vizualizing Government Debt Assignment

I decided to use the data set to show how gross government debt compared between the United States and its bordering countries, Mexico and Canada, during the Great Recession. 
I included the years 2008 and 2009 as the recession went into mid 2009. I used a horizontal side-by-side bar chart to portray this because I thought it would be an effective 
way to quickly see the differences in debt as a percentage of GDP. I chose to make the other countries bars gray and the US bars blue because the focus on on the debt of the US 
gross debt and how it compares to the bordering countries. I also included a label of the value of gross debt as a percentage of GDP for each country and year, so that the viewer 
can quickly see it.
